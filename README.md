<p> Source of the data file: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j</p>
<p>This is a second part of the term project where I take a larger data collected from NYC open data and use frameworks such as NumPY and pandas as well as Matplotlib to display interesting facts and try to automate the way restaurant inspection can be done.
